From from cert-manager docs,

> Issuers (and ClusterIssuers) represent a certificate authority from which signed x509 certificates can be obtained, such as Letâ€™s Encrypt. You will need at least one Issuer or ClusterIssuer in order to begin issuing certificates within your cluster.

[cert-manager docs](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/release-0.11/reference/issuers.html)

Note: prior to `kubectl apply`, add real email address to `email` key inside these `issuer` configs.
